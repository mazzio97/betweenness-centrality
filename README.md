# Betweenness Centrality

Project of "Algorithms and Data Structures" course at the University of Bologna.

## Definition

For every pair of vertices in a graph, consider (if there exists) all the shortest paths between them. The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the summation of the fractions of these shortest paths that pass through it.
